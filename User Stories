What issues did your team planned to address:
  
  - The main issues our team decided to tackle this sprint include being able to login/register in the front end, and having a way to store that in the back end. 
  
Which ones were successfully completed:
  
  - The issue of logging in and registering were sucessfully complete and implemented for both front and backend. That being said our group ran into quite a few issues getting the
    two linked, so the functionality works for both seaparately, but we just have not figured out how to make requests between the two.
  
  
Which ones didn't and why?:
  
    - We could also list the above one here because we haven't technically got it to work exactly as it should in final implementation. The problem relates to 
      us trying to get the front and back end linked.
