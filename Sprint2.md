Frontend Work Completed:

Backend Work Completed:
- Set up a database to store User and Event structs.
- Added CRUD functions for the backend team to analyze and test activity within the database.
- Integrated a register function which recieves a POST request. This function allows users to create an account on our website using their first name, last name, email, username, and password. If the username has already been taken by another user, the website will prompt the user to try registering again with a different username. After the user successfully registers their account, the backend will store this information in a User struct inside the website's database. 
- Integrated a login function which recieves a POST request. This function allows users to login to their account that they previously signed up with. When the user logs in, if their username or password is incorrect, the website will tell the user that one of the fields (username or passoword) is incorrect and prompt the user to try logging in again.
